<h2><a id="What_is_NUPredicts_1"></a>What is NUPredicts?</h2>
<p>NUPredicts is a market prediction game originally developed for Northwestern’s 2016 <strong>One Book, One Northwestern</strong> event. It has been added to Canvas as a module for instructors to use in their courses. Instructors can now make their own NUPredicts games and questions through an Admin Interface and students can answer those questions.</p>
<h2><a id="How_Does_NUPredicts_Work_4"></a>How Does NUPredicts Work?</h2>
<p>When we want to know what students think about an uncertain event, instructors can make a game out of it. For example, if our event is predicting the weather, we can ask “Will it Rain Tomorrow?”. Instructors can have 2 answers for students, let’s make them “Yes” and “No”. Students who play the game will predict if it will rain tomorrow or not and the instructor will find out who ended up right when scoring the game.</p>

<p>NUPredicts lets students apply their subject knowledge to relevant events that are happening in the world. The game format lets students see who scored similarly and lets the instructor see how their class thinks about ongoing events.</p>
